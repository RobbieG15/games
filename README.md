# Games 

 @RobbieG15

This repo is just a place to store all the games that I have made with python. None of them are built or ready for distribution, they are just pure python code behind the games that can be ran and tinkered with.

## pygameTemplate.py

The file `pygameTemplate.py` is what I use to setup any of the mini games that I create using the `pygame` module in python. It has a pretty good bare setup of how the games need setup.

## blackJack.py

The file `BlJa.py` is a blackjack game that is played within the terminal. It is single player and you play against the dealer who plays off of a specific set of rules. It is an interesting way to understand condtionals and loops in python.

## keepAway.py

The file `keepAway.py` is a little game I made with the `turtle` module in python to implement a gui and very simple ai mechanics. It is a game that has four enemies that chase the main player around the window.

## mathQuiz.py

The file `mathQuiz.py` is also a terminal game that asks very simple arithmatic questions. The questions consist of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The hope is to implement whole number division as well.

## pong.py

The file `pong.py` is a two player game made using the `turtle` module in python. It is a remake of the old style pong game and is played on one computer with people operating the arrow keys and wasd as well.

## twoPlayer.py

The file `twoPlayer.py` is my current project in terms of short games. The hope is to make another type of 2d game where players are fighting like space invaders in a way.
